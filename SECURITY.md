The Tab5duino-IDF team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [security@tab5duino.org] (replace with actual email)

If you prefer, you can also use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the repository's Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with detailed information

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, injection, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours until resolution
- **Resolution Target**: Within 90 days for critical issues, longer for complex issues

### Security Update Process

1. **Verification**: We verify and assess the security impact
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test a fix
3. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Work with you on disclosure timeline
4. **Release**: Issue security update and advisory
5. **Recognition**: Credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Considerations for Users

### Framework Security

Tab5duino-IDF provides several security features:

- **Memory Protection**: PSRAM-aware memory allocation prevents common buffer overflows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking prevents undefined behavior
- **Hardware Abstraction**: HAL layer provides validated hardware access
- **Component Isolation**: Modular architecture limits attack surface

### Secure Development Practices

When using Tab5duino-IDF, follow these security best practices:

#### Input Validation
```cpp
esp_err_t process_user_input(const char* input, size_t max_len) {
    // Always validate input parameters
    if (input == NULL || max_len == 0 || max_len > MAX_SAFE_LENGTH) {
        return ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG;
    }
    
    // Use secure string functions
    char buffer[MAX_SAFE_LENGTH];
    strncpy(buffer, input, max_len - 1);
    buffer[max_len - 1] = '\0';
    
    return ESP_OK;
}
```

#### Memory Management
```cpp
void* secure_malloc(size_t size) {
    // Use framework memory allocation
    void* ptr = Tab5duino.malloc(size);
    if (ptr) {
        // Zero initialize sensitive memory
        memset(ptr, 0, size);
    }
    return ptr;
}

void secure_free(void* ptr, size_t size) {
    if (ptr) {
        // Clear sensitive data before freeing
        memset(ptr, 0, size);
        Tab5duino.free(ptr);
    }
}
```

#### Hardware Access
```cpp
esp_err_t safe_gpio_access(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value) {
    // Validate pin numbers
    if (pin >= GPIO_NUM_MAX) {
        return ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG;
    }
    
    // Use framework GPIO functions
    digitalWrite(pin, value);
    return ESP_OK;
}
```

### Network Security

When implementing network functionality:

- Use TLS/SSL for all network communications
- Validate all network input
- Implement proper certificate verification
- Use secure random number generation for cryptographic operations

### OTA Security

For over-the-air updates:

- Verify firmware signatures before installation
- Use encrypted update channels
- Implement rollback capability for failed updates
- Validate firmware integrity

### Physical Security

Consider physical security implications:

- Debug interfaces can be disabled for production
- Secure boot can be enabled (ESP32-P4 feature)
- Flash encryption available for sensitive data
- Hardware security modules integration possible

## Known Security Considerations

### Hardware Limitations

- ESP32-P4 RISC-V architecture security features
- Hardware random number generator availability
- Secure storage limitations
- Debug interface exposure

### Framework Limitations

- Memory management relies on ESP-IDF heap implementation
- Some Arduino compatibility functions may have reduced security
- Hardware abstraction may not cover all security-relevant hardware features

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:

- **Critical**: Immediate patch release (within 24 hours)
- **High**: Patch release within 7 days
- **Medium**: Next minor version release
- **Low**: Next major version release

### Notification Channels

Subscribe to security updates through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notifications
- Security mailing list (if available)

## Responsible Disclosure Program

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- Work with security researchers to understand and fix issues
- Provide credit to researchers who report issues responsibly
- Coordinate disclosure timing to protect users
- Maintain transparency about security issues and fixes

### Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- Credited in the security advisory (if desired)
- Listed in the project's security contributors
- Notified of fix releases before public disclosure
